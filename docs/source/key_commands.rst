Key Commands
------------

The application uses a three-key command system for rotations:

1. **Observed Face Key** (``r``, ``o``, ``g``, ``b``, ``w``, ``y``): The face you're looking at
2. **Rotation Direction Key** (``l``, ``u``, ``r``, ``d``): Which adjacent face to rotate (left, up, right, down)
3. **Clockwise Flag** (``y``, ``n``): Rotation direction (yes=clockwise, no=counter-clockwise)

**Example:** ``('w', 'u', 'y')`` means "looking at white face, rotate the upper adjacent face clockwise"
